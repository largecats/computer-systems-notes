\textbf{Practice Problem 2.35}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $x\cdot y$, the integer product of $x$ and $y$, can be written in the form
    $x \cdot y = p + t2^w$, where $t\neq 0$ if and only if the computation of $p$ overflows.

    % $x\cdot y$ can be represented by $2w$ bits. Let $u, v$ denote the unsigned and two's complement numbers represented by the lower and upper $w$ bits, respectively. By Equation 2.3, the two's complement encoding of $x\cdot y$ is

    % \begin{align*}
    %     B2T_w(x\cdot y) = u + v
    % \end{align*}

    \item Show that $p$ can be written in the form $p = x \cdot q + r$, where $|r| < |x|$.
    \item Show that $q = y$ if and only if $r = t = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
